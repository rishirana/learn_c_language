<h2>Pointer Address</h2>
<div class="box">
	<i>Pointers are powerful features of C and (C++) programming that differentiates it from other popular programming languages like: Java and Python.Pointers are used in C program to access the memory and manipulate the address.
</i>
</div>
<h4>Reference Operator(&):</h4>
<p>If you have a variable var in your program, &var will give you its address in the memory, where & is commonly called the reference operator.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<div class="syn">
	<span style="color:cyan;">/* Example to demonstrate use of reference operator in C programming. */<br><br>
#include < stdio.h><br>
int main()<br>
{<br>
  int var = 5;<br>
  printf("Value: %d\n", var);<br>
  printf("Address: %u", &var);<br
    //Notice, the ampersand(&) before var.<br>
  return 0;<br>
}</span>
</div>
<h5>Output:</h5>
<div class="output">
	Value: 5 <br><br>
Address: 2686778
</div>
<p><span style="color:#212121;"><strong>Note:</strong></span>You may obtain different value of address while using this code.<br><br>

In above source code, value 5 is stored in the memory location 2686778. var is just the name given to that location.</p>
<h4>Pointer Variable:</h4>
<p>In C, there is a special variable that stores just the address of another variable. It is called Pointer variable or, simply, a pointer.<br><br> Declaration of Pointer</p>

<div class="syntax">
	data_type* pointer_variable_name;<br>
int* p;
</div>
<h4>Dereference Operator:</h4>
<p>As discussed, & is called reference operator. It gives you the address of a variable.<br><br>

Likewise, there is another operator that gets you the value from the address, it is called a dereference operator (*).<br><br>

Below example clearly demonstrates the use of pointers, reference operator and dereference operator.</p>

<p><span style="color:#212121;">Note</span> The * sign when declaring a pointer is not a dereference operator. It is just a similar notation that creates a pointer.</p>

<div class="syn">
<span style="color:cyan;">	/* Source code to demonstrate, handling of pointers in C program */<br>
#include < stdio.h ><br>
int main(){<br>
   int* pc;<br><br>
   int c;<br>
   c=22;<br>
   printf("Address of c:%u\n",&c);<br>
   printf("Value of c:%d\n\n",c);<br><br>
   pc=&c;<br>
   printf("Address of pointer pc:%u\n",pc);<br>
   printf("Content of pointer pc:%d\n\n",*pc);<br><br>
   c=11;<br>
   printf("Address of pointer pc:%u\n",pc);<br>
   printf("Content of pointer pc:%d\n\n",*pc);<br><br>
   *pc=2;<br>
   printf("Address of c:%u\n",&c);<br>
   printf("Value of c:%d\n\n",c);<br>
   return 0;<br>
}</span>
</div>
<div class="output">
	Address of c: 2686784<br>
Value of c: 22<br><br>

Address of pointer pc: 2686784<br>
Content of pointer pc: 22<br><br>

Address of pointer pc: 2686784<br>
Content of pointer pc: 11<br><br>

Address of c: 2686784<br>
Value of c: 2<br>
</div>

<h5>Common Mistakes When Working With Pointers</h5>
<p>Suppose you want pointer pc to point to the address of c . Then,</p>
<div class="box">
	
int c, *pc;<br><br>

// Wrong! pc is address whereas, c is not an address.<br>
pc = c;  <br><br>

// Wrong! *pc is the value pointed by address whereas, %amp;c is an address.<br>
*pc = &c; <br><br>

// Correct! pc is an address and, %amp;pc is also an address.<br>
pc = &c; <br><br>

// Correct! *pc is the value pointed by address and, c is also a value.<br>
*pc = c;<br><br>
</div>
