<h2>Union</h2>
<div class="box">
	<I>Unions are quite similar to structures in C. Like structures, unions are also derived types. The only difference is in storage. In structure each member has its own storage location , whereas all members of union uses a single shared memory location which is equal to largest data member.</I>
</div>
<h5>Declaration:</h5>
<P>Union variables can be created in similar manner as structure variables. It is declared using <strong>union</strong>keyword.</P>
<div class="syntax">
	<b>union</b> car<br>
{<br>
  char name[50];<br>
  int price;<br>
};
</div><br>
<center>Or</center>
<div class="syntax">
	<strong>union</strong> car<br>
{<br>
  char name[50];<br>
  int price;<br>
};<br>

int main()<br>
{<br>
  <strong>union</strong> car car1, car2, *car3;<br>
  return 0;<br>
}
</div>
<h4>Accessing member of union:</h4>
<p>Again, the member of unions can be accessed in similar manner as structures.<br><br>

In the above example, suppose you want to access price for union variable car1, it can be accessed as:</p>

<div class="syntax">
	car1.price;
</div>
<p>Likewise, if you want to access price for the union pointer variable car3, it can be accessed as:</p>
<div class="syntax">
	(*car3).price<br>
   or<br>
car3->price
</div>
<h4>Difference between Union & Structure:</h4>

<h5><i>Output:</i></h5>
<div class="output">
	size of union = 32<br><br>
size of structure = 40
</div>
