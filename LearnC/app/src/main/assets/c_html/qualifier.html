<h1>Qualifier</h1>

<p>Qualifier give one of two properties to an identifier.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>const</b> - it declare object to be non-modifiable</li>
	<li><b>volatile</b>- it declare an item whose value can legitimately be changed by something beyond the control of the program in which it appears.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>const</b> keyword can be used to modify any fundamental or aggregate type,or a pointer to an object of any type , or a <b>typedef</b> If an item is declared with only the <b>const</b> type qualifier, its type is taken to be <b>const int</b> . A <b>const</b> variable ccan be initialized or can be placed in a read-only region of storage. The <b>const</b> keyword is useful for declaring pointers to <b>const</b> since this requires the function not to change the pointer in any way.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The compiler assumes that, at any point in the program , a <b>volatile</b> variable can be accessed by an unknown process that uses or modifies its value. Therefore  regardless of the optimizations specified on the command line, the code for each assignment to or reference of a volatile variable must be generated even if it appears to have no effect.</li>
<br>  <li>An item can be both <b>const </b> and <b>volatile</b> , in which case the item could not be legitimately modified by its own program, but could be modified by some asynchronous process.</li>
</ul>
