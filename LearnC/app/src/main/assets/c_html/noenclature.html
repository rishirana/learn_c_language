<h1>Nomenclature-:</h1>
<h2>Tokens</h2>
<p>A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either  a keyword , an identifier , a constant , a string literal ,or a symbol.</p>
<ol>
	<li>keywords</li>
	<li>Identifiers</li>
	<li>Constants</li>
	<li>Strings</li>
	<li>Special Symbols</li>
	<li>Operators</li>
</ol>

<h2>Semicolons</h2>
In a C program , the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is , each individual statement must be ended with semicolon . It indicates the end of the one logical entity.

<h2>Comments</h2>
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and  terminate with the character */ for multiline comment. And for one line comment we can use // at the starting of line.
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable , function,or any other user-defined item.An identifier starts with a letter A to Z , a to z or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letteres, underscores,and digits(0 to 9).
<h2>Keywords</h2>
The following list shows the reserved words in C . These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.

 <h2>Whitespace</h2>
 <p>A line containing only whitespace possibly with a comment , is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
 	
 </p>
 <p>white space is the term used in C to describe blanks , tabs , newline characters and comments.</p>
 <p>Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement , such as int , ends and the next element begins.</p>
 <h2>Constants</h2>
 <p>Constants are the fixed value that do not change during the execution of the program.</p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Integer Constants</li>
 	<li>Real Constants</li>
 	<li>Single Character Constants</li>
 	<li>String Constants</li>
 	<li>Backslash Constants</li>
 </ol>
