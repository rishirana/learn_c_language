<h2>TypeDef</h2>
<div class="box">
	<i>The C programming language provides a keyword called <strong>typedef</strong>, which you can use to give a type, a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers:</i>
</div><br>

<div class="syntax">
	typedef unsigned char BYTE;
</div>
<P>After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example...</P>
<div class="state">
	BYTE b1,b2;
</div>
<p>By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows âˆ’</p>
<div class="syntax">
	typedef unsigned char byte;
</div>
<p>You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well.</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>

<h4><u>typedef Vs. #define</u></h4>
<p><strong>#define</strong> is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to <strong>typedef</strong> but with the following differences:</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><strong>typedef</strong> is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as <strong>#define</strong> can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.</li>
	<li><strong>typedef</strong> interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas <strong>#define</strong> statements are processed by the pre-processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows how to use <strong>#define</strong> in a program:</p>
