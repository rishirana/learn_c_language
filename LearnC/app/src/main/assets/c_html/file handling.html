<h2>File Handling</h2>
<div class="state">
	<i>A file represents a sequence of bytes. regardless of its being a text file or a binary file. C prgramming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your storage devices. </i>

</div>
<p>In C programming, file is a place on disk where a group of related data is stored. </p>
<h3>Why Files are Needed ?</h3>
<p>When the program is terminated, the entire data is lost in C programming. If you want to keep large volume of data, it is time consuming to enter the entire data. But  if file is created , these information can be accessed using few commands.</p>
<p>There are large numbers of functions to handle file I/O in C language . In this tutorial , you will learn to handle standard I/O (High level file I/O functions) in C.</p>
<p><strong>High level file I/O functions can be categorized as :</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Text File </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Binary File</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Text File:</h4>
<p>Text files are the normal .txt files that you can easily create using Notepad or any simple text editors.</p>
<p>When you open those files, you'll see all the contents within the file as plain text. You can easily edit or delete the contents.</p>
<p>They take minimum effort to maintain, are easily readable, and provide least security and takes bigger storage space.</p>
<h4>Binary File:</h4>
<p>Binary files are mostly the .bin files in your computer.</p>
<p>Instead of storing data in plain text, they store it in the binary form (0's and 1's).</p>
<p>They can hold higher amount of data, are not readable easily and provides a better security than text files.</p>
<h3>File Operations:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Creating a new file</li>
	<li>Opening an existing file</li>
	<li>Reading from and writing information to a file</li>
	<li>Closing a file</li>
</ol>
<h4>Working with File:</h4>
<p>While working with file, you need to declare a <strong>pointer</strong> of type file. This declaration is needed for communication between file and program.</p>
<div class="syntax">
	FILE *ptr;
</div>
<h3>File Handling Functions:</h3>
<p>C provides a number of functions that helps to perform basic file operations. Following are the functions</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Function</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fopen()</td>
		<td>create a new file or open a existing file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fclose()</td>
		<td>closes a file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>getc()</td>
		<td>reads a character from a file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>putc()</td>
		<td>write a character to file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fscanf()</td>
		<td>reads a set of data from  file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fprintf()</td>
		<td>writes a set of data to a file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>getw()</td>
		<td>reads a integer from  file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>putw()</td>
		<td>writes a integer to  file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fseek()</td>
		<td>set the position to desire point</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ftell()</td>
		<td>give current position in the  file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>rewind()</td>
		<td>set the position to the begining point</td>
	</tr>
</table>
