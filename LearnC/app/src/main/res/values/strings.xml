       C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by  <i>Dennis Ritchie</i>
        for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Eqquipment Corpora
        tion PDP-11 computer in 1972.\n

       The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language.
        C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.\n\n\n
       1. Easy to learn\n
       2. Structured language.\n
       3. It produces efficient programs.\n
       4. It can handle low-level activities.\n
       5. It can be compiled on a variety of computers.\n

       * C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.\n
       * C is a successor of B language which was introduced around 1970.\n
       * The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institue (ANSI).\n
       * By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in C.\n
       * Today C is the most widely used System Programming Language.\n
       * Most of the state of the art software have been implemented using C.\n

    <font color="blue" size="20"> <b>  Why to use C ?</b></font>\n\n

     C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the
        operating system. C was adoped as a system development language because it produces code
        that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of
        C might be:\n\n

    Operating Systems\n
    Language Compilers\n
    Assemblers\n
    Text Editors\n
    Print Spoolers\n
    Network Drivers\n
    Modern Programs\n
    Data Bases\n
    Language Interpreters\n
    Utilities\n
